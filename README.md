## Objectives

Upon completion of this exercise, you will have demonstrated the ability to:

- Identify the problem
- Construct an algorithm
- Translate an algorithm into C#
- Test an executable program.

Your solution will be assessed for **validity** (correctly solving the problem), **efficiency** (doing so without [extraneous](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/extraneous) code), **maintainability** (how well the solution can be modified in the face of changing requirements), and **coding standards** (as outlined in class and directed by your instructor). Be sure to stay within the boundaries of the requirements for this assignment; if you need any clarifications, please direct them to your instructor.

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with creating a console application that calculates the area of a triangle. The formula is 

$$
a = \frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot b
$$

where $a$ is the area, $b$ is the base length and $h$ is the height. Prompt the user for the height and base (*in that order*) and then display the value of the area. Assume that the user input will be integer values; the calculated area should be a real value.
